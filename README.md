# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression

#### Case study - "Implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck."

Files that I had to write code in to were:
<em> warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB
plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables
featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations
